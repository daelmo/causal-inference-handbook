# Academic

## Doctoral

In general, applying for a PhD is a complex endavour, but your primary goal should be to identify groups around the world that align with your interests. The fact that you are looking for PhDs in the area of causal inference indicates that you are already on the right path. While it is highly recommended that you do your own research into what groups and people are out there, here is a list of people that tend to take on PhDs with a focus on causal inference, and are worth contacting. 

*Note: Do your homework and get to know their research first. This saves time for both sides: You will know whether you are a match and they will be able to hold an informed reserach discussion with you.*

## Post-doctoral

### Quantum Causal Inference at Purdue

The Electrodynamics Lab (https://www.electrodynamics.org/) under Prof. Zubin Jacob and CLAN Lab (https://engineering.purdue.edu/CLANLabs) under Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal at Purdue University are actively seeking a post-doctoral candidate with experience in one or more of the following areas:

 *   Causal inference
 *   Entropic approaches to information theory
 *   Quantum information theory
 *   Quantum tomography
 *   Quantum machine learning
Successful candidates will work closely with computer scientists, theoretical physicists and experimentalists to develop/test algorithms for real-world applications. There will be creative freedom to shape the research project in the broad area of quantum causal inference and undertake leadership roles.

The appointment is an annual contract, renewable up to three years pending funding availability and performance. The position is immediately available. Applicants should have completed their PhD by the time of their appointment. Evaluation of applicants will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. Applicants must be legally eligible to work in the United States. There are no teaching obligations.
Interested candidates are requested to send a CV and three representative publications to Prof. Zubin Jacob (zjacob@purdue.edu<mailto:zjacob@purdue.edu>) and Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal (vaneet@purdue.edu<mailto:vaneet@purdue.edu>).
