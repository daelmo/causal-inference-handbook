Causal Inference Handbook
============================
*A friendly introduction to causal inference*

<!-- # How to read
Head over to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/limorigu/causal-inf-handbook/wiki) for all entires on fundamentals of causal inference! -->

## Welcome to the causal inference handbook wiki!

This is meant to be a resource for causal-curious folks who are looking for accessible introduction to common topics in causal inference.
